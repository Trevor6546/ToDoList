This program allows the user to create a custom to-do list. Users can add, delete, and mark as complete on their customized to-do list.

**Features:**
  - Add "to-dos" to your list
  - Delete "to-dos" from your list
  - Mark specific "to-dos" as completed

**Installation:**
A zip folder containing the files used in the to-do list can be downloaded from this GitHub, however, you must have Flask installed on your computer to run the files as intended.

**Usage:**
Each function within the Python file is outlined to tell you what feature it corresponds with. The HTML file shows how each feature is represented in the application.

**Contributing:**
